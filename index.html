			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring corporate owners and evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is the disparity in eviction filings between live-in/live-nearby landlords compared to absentee/corporate landlords statistically significant? Is it concentrated/driven by certain neighborhoods, socioeconomic demographics, or other factors? How has COVID impacted this disparity?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Motivation: this disparity is clearly a problem, but it is likely so widespread it would be difficult to priotize initiatives to tackle the issue without some measure of severity</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Where has corporate ownership overtime experienced the biggest change? Does normalizing either for land area or some measure of wealth change the which neighborhoods are the biggest hotspots? What does this imply about future trends in corporate ownership if nothing is done? Are there any guardrails that could stop or reverse any trends today?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Motivation: Just want to understand if there is saturation in corporate ownership or if we are still in the middle of a long wave. This can provide some context on the scale of the issue was well as where we need to focus without simply looking at totals which is why the normalization piece feels important to me.</li>
					</ul>
				<li> Which demographics were impacted COVID evictions more than others? Did corporate ownership accelerate or slow during COVID?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Motivation: COVID obviously had an enourmous impact on housing and the financial sector and I am curious to know if corporate owners got more aggressive either in evicitions or in buying up properties as a result. </li>
					</ul>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			After actually digging into the data, I realized a few major things. Firstly, there is no eviction data. There is 2020 census data, corporate ownership data over time (2004-2024), and owner occupancy data over time (2004-2024). The demographic data being only a snapshot from 2020 meant I had to be careful about when I used sum vs average vs filtering for a specific year. I learned this the hard way when the population of the metro Boston area was showing up over 13M initially. The description of the dataset and subtheme made me think there was eviction data with fields for live in/live nearby landlords vs corporate landlords, but unfortunately that is not the case. I was able to pivot my analysis and visualization to focus understanding where different demographics of people live and what the corresponding trends in corporate ownership and owner occupancy is in those areas.

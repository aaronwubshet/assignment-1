			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring corporate owners and evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is the disparity in eviction filings between live-in/live-nearby landlords compared to absentee/corporate landlords statistically significant? Is it concentrated/driven by certain neighborhoods, socioeconomic demographics, or other factors? How has COVID impacted this disparity?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Motivation: this disparity is clearly a problem, but it is likely so widespread it would be difficult to prioritize initiatives to tackle the issue without some measure of severity</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Where has corporate ownership overtime experienced the biggest change? Does normalizing either for land area or some measure of wealth change the which neighborhoods are the biggest hot spots? What does this imply about future trends in corporate ownership if nothing is done? Are there any guardrails that could stop or reverse any trends today?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Motivation: Just want to understand if there is saturation in corporate ownership or if we are still in the middle of a long wave. This can provide some context on the scale of the issue was well as where we need to focus without simply looking at totals which is why the normalization piece feels important to me.</li>
					</ul>
				<li> Which demographics were impacted COVID evictions more than others? Did corporate ownership accelerate or slow during COVID?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Motivation: COVID obviously had an enormous impact on housing and the financial sector and I am curious to know if corporate owners got more aggressive either in evictions or in buying up properties as a result. </li>
					</ul>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			After actually digging into the data, I realized a few major things. Firstly, there is no eviction data. There is 2020 census data, corporate ownership data over time (2004-2024), and owner occupancy data over time (2004-2024). The demographic data being only a snapshot from 2020 meant I had to be careful about when I used sum vs average vs filtering for a specific year. I learned this the hard way when the population of the metro Boston area was showing up over 13M initially. The description of the dataset and sub-theme made me think there was eviction data with fields for live in/live nearby landlords vs corporate landlords, but unfortunately that is not the case. I was able to pivot my analysis and visualization to focus understanding where different demographics of people live and what the corresponding trends in corporate ownership and owner occupancy is in those areas. Given the large number of neighborhoods also I found sizing and readability to an issue throughout the visualization process and something I'd like to improve on in the future.

				<figcaption>
				This plot shows the total population living in each metro Boston neighborhood in 2020 split by race / ethnicity. Initially I was hesitant to create a plot that focused on race, but I realized that it was important to understand the racial breakdown of the area to understand the context of the data. I was surprised to see Dorchester as the most populated area. I've lived in the metro Boston area for nearly 6 years and only recently started to spend time in Dorchester. The racial division of most neighborhoods leaves a dominate race is most neighborhoods (e.g., South Boston is primarily white, Hyde Park and Mattapan are primarily black, Chinatown is primarily Asian and Pacific Islander, etc.). However, Roxbury, Dorchester, and East Boston are the most diverse neighborhoods. I'd love to be able to layer on wealth or income data to understand the intersectionality from here.

				<img src="images/college.png" alt="bar chart of number of people living in student housing" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This plot shows the metro Boston population living in college/university housing by neighborhood. This was both surprising and unsurprising in different ways. The concentration of student housing in Fenway due to Boston University, Roxbury with Northeastern, Downtown with Tufts and Emerson all seemed reasonable. I could generally point to what university was driving the population of each neighborhood. The surprising part was the overall number of students. Boston is often anecdotally referred to as a college town, but ~30,000 residing in student housing relative to the 1.3M total population is not as high as I would have expected.

				<img src="images/corpown.png" alt="corporate ownership trend over time by neighborhood" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This plot shows the trends in corporate ownership from 2004 to 2024 in the metro Boston area with a different trend line for each neighborhood. There is also an overall trend line for the metro Boston area, with the 2004 and 2024 data points labeled. The overall trend line shows a steady increase in corporate ownership over time. The neighborhood trend lines show a lot of variation, but the overall trend is still visible. The neighborhoods with the most corporate ownership in 2024 are Fenway, Downtown, and South Boston. These neighborhoods are also those with relatively high portion of the population being white. Fenway being less so, but also being dominated by college housing based on the prior graph. The neighborhoods with the least corporate ownership in 2024 are Hyde Park, Mattapan, and Roslindale. These neighborhoods have much higher Black, Hispanic, or Asian populations. I was surprised to see the ownership rates to be slowly increasing in the first decade, but after about 2014, the trend seemed to increase more drastically. I am curious to see if there will be any sort of saturation or decline in corporate ownership over time, along with what this trend looks like more broadly in the US. The ~5x increase in corporate ownership on average is also noteworthy.

				<img src="images/ownerocc.png" alt="owner occupancy trends over time bey neighborhood" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This plot similar to the prior one shows trends in owner occupancy from 2004 to 2024 in the metro Boston area with a different trend line for each neighborhood. There is also an overall trend line for the metro Boston area, with the 2004 and 2024 data points labeled. The overall trend line shows a steady decrease in owner occupancy over time but not as drastic as the increase in corporate ownership. There has been a 5% drop over the last 20 years which may or may not be statically significant especially when looking at the variation from neighborhood to neighborhood. Unsurprisingly, the areas with higher corporate ownership rate also tend to have lower owner occupancy rates. This may be a bit of leap, but there definitely seems to be a potential correlation. Neighborhoods with residents that are more affluent or have a greater need (e.g., college students) are more likely to be owned by corporations. I would be curious to see if there is a correlation between the owner occupancy rate and the average income of the neighborhood.

				<img src="images/occ_vacc.png" alt="occupancy vs vacant population by neighborhood" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This plot shows the split of occupied vs vacant units by neighborhood. The most shocking thing about this plot was the very low vacancy rates across all the neighborhoods. It seems as though there are very few units not being utilized by a tencent which seems to indicate there is a supply shortage for housing in the metro Boston area. The two areas with relatively higher vacancy rates around 20% are South Boston Waterfront and Downtown, two areas known for having higher rents which may be related. On the other hand Brighton, Roslindale, and Hyde Park have the lowest vacancy rates at about 4%. The majority of the neighborhoods however hover at 6-10% vacancy rates. Being able to layer in new build data would be an interesting way to understand what is driving the vacancy rates.

				<img src="images/vacantstack.png" alt="100% stack bar of vacant units by neighborhood" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This plot takes just the vacant portion of the prior stacked bar chart and makes it a 100% stacked bar chart. This makes it easier to see the relative proportion of vacant units in each neighborhood. This demonstrates the spread of vacant units across all neighborhoods more clearly with 6 neighborhoods having nearly 50% of all vacancies and another dozen comprising the next ~50%

			<figure>
				<img src="images/occupiedcountbubble.png" alt="bubble chart of occupied units" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This bubble chart shows similar information to the prior chart but focuses on occupied units not vacant ones. The spread across neighborhoods is even more visible when comparing the size of the different circles. Initially I attempted to create a bubble chart with each bubble being a separate pie chart with a different measure being used to add another dimension to the data, but this proved very difficult and I was unable to get it to work. I would like to revisit this in the future.

				<img src="images/noncollegegroup.png" alt="bar chart of people living in group quarters not including college aged" style = "width: 100%; height: 70%" />
				<figcaption>
				This final plot compares the number of people living in group quarters not including college aged people in university housing. This effectively allowed for me to control for a portion of the population that would be expected to be in group quarters. Roxbury and Dorchester rising to the top here despite Roxbury having Northeastern University nearby is very telling as to the structure of housing in that neighborhood. Again layering in more socioeconomic data would be very interesting to see how this data intersects with wealth or income.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Ultimately, I was unable to answer most of the questions that initially got me interested in the data set around evictions, but there was still some extremely interesting insights to be drawn from the data. The role of neighborhoods, race, and education were the primary ones I focused on. There were multiple questions and next steps that came to mind as I was conducting the exploratory portion of the analysis and thoughts about predicting corporate ownership rates are still flying through my head now. I would also love to start to look for third party data on evictions in order to go back and answer some of my initial questions. There is a lot of concern that can stem from the rapid increase in corporate ownership rates over the last 20 years. I focused on neighborhood breakdown, but other demographics could also be used though the limitation of the census data being from 2020 made me hesitate to plot corporate ownership rates for say nursing homes over time when the total population in nursing homes is a flat value from 2020. There are plenty of further questions to be asked and answer on this data set and other related data sets. </p>
